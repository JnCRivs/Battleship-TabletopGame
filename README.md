<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Battleship, better known in Spanish as <em> batalla naval </em>, had its beginnings in pencil and paper. It was played in the 1900's mainly among the soldiers of the World War I. At that time they would draw a grid on paper and place ships on it.

In 1943, Milton Bradley launched the game in a pencil and paper version. But it was not until 1967 that he published it as it is known today. It was very well received as many were already familiar with the concept and seeing it in a three-dimensional form was a novelty. In 1977 an electronic version was released. There are different versions of the game on the market, but all based on the same concept.
